The field of modern physics was largely shaped by a series of groundbreaking discoveries and intense collaborations in the early 20th century. The journey into radioactivity began in 1896 when Henri Becquerel, a physicist in Paris, discovered that uranium salts emitted a new form of penetrating radiation. Inspired by his work, Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, began their own pivotal research at the Sorbonne University. Working with the mineral pitchblende, they conducted painstaking experiments that led to the discovery of two new elements in 1898: Polonium, which Marie named after her home country of Poland, and the highly radioactive element Radium. For this foundational work, Marie and Pierre Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with Henri Becquerel. Marie Curie later won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her continued research and isolation of pure radium.

Simultaneously, a revolution was brewing in theoretical physics. Albert Einstein, while working in Bern, Switzerland, published his paper on the photoelectric effect in 1905, a cornerstone of quantum theory for which he would later win the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. This work heavily influenced Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist who, in 1913, proposed the Bohr model of the atom, which incorporated quantum ideas to explain atomic structure. For decades, Einstein and Bohr engaged in a series of famous debates about the philosophical implications and completeness of quantum mechanics, particularly challenging the Copenhagen interpretation championed by Bohr and his colleagues.

These theoretical advancements had profound practical consequences during World War II. In the United States, the Manhattan Project was established to develop the first atomic bomb. The project was scientifically directed by J. Robert Oppenheimer at the newly created Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. A key breakthrough for the project came from Enrico Fermi, an Italian-American physicist who led a team at the University of Chicago. In 1942, they successfully created Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial self-sustaining nuclear reactor, proving that a nuclear chain reaction was possible. Fermi's work was crucially supported by Leo Szilard, who had originally conceived of the nuclear chain reaction and co-authored a letter with Albert Einstein to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging the creation of the atomic research program.

Within the theoretical division at Los Alamos, a brilliant young physicist named Richard Feynman made significant contributions to the project's calculations. The collective effort culminated in the Trinity test in July 1945, the first successful detonation of a nuclear weapon. After the war, Feynman's own work in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), for which he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, greatly built upon the quantum foundations established by pioneers like Niels Bohr, further refining humanity's understanding of the universe.
